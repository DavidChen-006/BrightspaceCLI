//
// `CacheOutcome` and `CourseSourceError` are deliberately NOT redefined here —
// they come from `CoursePipeline`. Two backend modules with two vocabularies for
// "the fetch failed, keep what you had" would be two places to keep in sync, and
// the translation layer would have to speak both.

/// Which D2L entity an item is.

/// The kinds share everything the pipeline does — fan-out, folding,
/// success-replaces/failure-preserves, orphan cleanup — and differ only in where
/// they come from and how they are presented: the route they are fetched from, the
/// decoder that reads them, the deep-link template they open, and what the row says
/// about a deadline. So the kind travels as a *field* rather than as a second type,
/// and the only code that switches on it is the translation layer.
///
/// `CaseIterable` so a future kind (a graded discussion, a checklist) is
/// discoverable rather than hidden inside a switch.

/// should appear in a menu is a display policy, and burying it in a parser would
/// put it where no test thinks to look.
///
