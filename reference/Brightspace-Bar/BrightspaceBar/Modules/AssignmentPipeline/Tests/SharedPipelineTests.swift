// ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// TWO ENTITY KINDS, ONE PIPELINE.
//
// Quizzes are a separate D2L entity on a separate route with a separate envelope
// and a separate deep-link template. What they are NOT is a separate pipeline:
// fan-out, per-course folding, success-replaces/failure-preserves, orphan cleanup,
// and the three states are all indifferent to which kind of work an item is. So
// `Assignment` carries a `kind`, and ONE store and ONE fetcher serve both.
//
// WHERE THE MERGE MOVED (phase 5). This file used to specify
// `CompositeAssignmentSource`, the Swift value that fetched the two routes and
// concatenated them below the store. The daemon does that now: the Node fetcher
// requests `dropbox/folders` and `quizzes/` per course (`Promise.all`), merges
// them assignments-first, and writes ONE list per course into `cache/data.json`
// with `kind` on every item — so by the time Swift sees it, the two-ness is
// already gone. The composite's own claims therefore left Swift rather than being
// dropped; the report accompanying this rewrite names each one's new home
// (`session-capture/tests/fetch-engine.test.mjs` for the merge, the ordering, and
// the half-a-loaf rule; `DaemonAssignmentSourceTests` for the decode side).
//
// PRIORITY: REUSE, NOT DUPLICATION — and testable rather than aspirational. The
// tempting shortcut was always a parallel `QuizStore`/`QuizFetcher`, which
// compiles, passes its own tests, and then diverges: two folds to keep in sync,
// two orphan-cleanup rules, and a course whose assignments succeeded while its
// quizzes failed sitting in two contradictory states. Every test below reads BOTH
// kinds out of ONE `state(for:)`, which is unsatisfiable by a two-store design —
// that is the point, and it survives the merge moving to the daemon.
//
// CULLED: throughput, retry policy, and any per-kind display concern (that is the
// translation layer's, tested in `QuizSectionTests`).
//
// SCOPE: all small. Fakes, an injected clock, no I/O and no wall-clock waiting.
