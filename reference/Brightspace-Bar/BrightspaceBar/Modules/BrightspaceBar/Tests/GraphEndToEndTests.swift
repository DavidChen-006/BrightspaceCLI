// ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// THE FULL VERTICAL SLICE — fixture bytes in, a visible strip out.
//
// The four graph parts each carry their own suite: the contract
// (GraphCellTests), the stub seeds (StubGraphSeedTests), the mapping
// (GraphTranslationTests), and the rendering (MenuAssemblerGraphTests). What
// none of them proves is the WIRING: that real captured payloads flow through
// the real parser → composite source → store → translation chain and come out
// the other end as a strip item the menu actually shows. This suite is that
// proof, and it is the orchestrator's acceptance test for the slice.
//
// PRIORITIES:
//
//   1. NO TEST DOUBLES PAST THE BYTES. The only fake here is where the bytes
//      come from (files on disk instead of a socket — the same boundary the live
//      app crosses). EnrollmentParser, DaemonAssignmentSource, AssignmentStore,
//      AssignmentFetcher, MenuTranslation, GraphTranslation, and MenuAssembler
//      are all the real objects, assembled the way `main.swift` assembles them.
//
//      Phase 5 moved the assignment half of that boundary. The app no longer
//      parses D2L's own dropbox and quiz payloads — the Node daemon does, and
//      merges both kinds into ONE list per course in `cache/data.json`. So the
//      bytes this suite feeds in are a canned daemon cache rather than two
//      captured D2L payloads through `AssignmentParser`/`QuizParser`, and
//      `CompositeAssignmentSource` (which merged them in Swift) is gone.
//
//   2. THE INTERESTING DATES ARE REAL. Both an assignment and a quiz carry
//      `2026-03-01T04:59:00.000Z` — which is Feb 28, 23:59 LOCAL in Indiana, and
//      is the instant the retired captures carried, transcribed verbatim. One
//      instant exercises the 11 PM boundary (a UTC-Sunday deadline bucketing to
//      local Saturday) and, because an assignment and a quiz share it,
//      highest-tier-wins — end to end, not as a unit rule. The fractional
//      seconds are kept deliberately: they exercise the daemon decoder's
//      two-attempt date path on the way through.
//
// CULLED: pixels (colour, outline geometry — visual, verified in stub mode),
// polling, disk persistence, and the network itself (BS_LIVE covers the
// socket).
//
// SCOPE: medium — many real components, one process, no I/O beyond fixture
// reads.
// ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
