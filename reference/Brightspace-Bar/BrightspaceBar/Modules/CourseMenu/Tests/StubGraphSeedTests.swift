// ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// THE STUB'S SEEDED STRIPS — the data the renderer is developed against.
//
// `StubMenuDataSource` is production code that hands the GUI a finished
// `MenuModel` with no backend at all (`BRIGHTSPACEBAR_STUB=1`). Stage 2 builds the
// renderer against it, which means the seeds are not decoration: they are the
// only inputs the renderer will be exercised with until the mapping layer lands.
//
// The window is POSITIONAL — 112 cells, index is the day offset from WINDOW
// START, and window start is the Sunday of today's week — and the stub carries
// FINISHED `GraphCell` values. Any "both kinds on one day" has already been
// resolved to the higher tier upstream; the stub demonstrates the OUTCOME, not
// the resolution.
//
// RE-PINNED for NewVertical-3 §4. Three things moved:
//   • 28 cells → 112 (16 weeks, the multiple of 7 §3.3 promises the grid).
//   • `isToday` is no longer index 0. The window opens on Sunday, so today sits
//     somewhere in cells 0–6. The seeds pick index 2 (a Tuesday), matching the
//     mapping suite's and the E2E suite's pinned instants.
//   • "A course with no strip at all" CEASED TO EXIST. Always-emit (§2 item 2)
//     makes `[]` unreachable from `GraphTranslation`, so no seed may demonstrate
//     it — a renderer developed against a `[]` seed would be developed against a
//     state the backend can no longer produce.
//
// PRIORITIES:
//
//   1. VISUAL COVERAGE. Every state the renderer can be in must be reachable by
//      launching the stub: a filled cell, an empty cell, a today cell that also
//      carries work, a today cell that does not, work on a day of the current
//      week that has ALREADY PASSED (new — the window now reaches behind today),
//      work on the window's last index, and an entirely empty window. A seed set
//      that drifts silently loses one of those states, and the renderer bug it
//      was hiding ships — the human verification step is only as good as the
//      seeds.
//
//   2. DETERMINISM. The seeds are literals, not clock-derived, so a screenshot
//      taken today and one taken next month show the same strip. These tests pin
//      exact indices for that reason; a seed built from `Date()` would make them
//      flap and would make visual review unrepeatable.
//
// CULLED: everything about the mapping (window range, local-day bucketing, the
// 11 PM boundary, highest-tier-wins as a computation) — that is stage 4, tested
// with an injected clock. Also culled: `CellTier`/`GraphCell` shape claims, which
// `GraphCellTests` already owns, and drawing/palette, which is the renderer's.
//
// SCOPE: all small. Pure values; the one `async` test only crosses the
// `MenuDataSource` protocol, which the stub answers from memory.
// ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// PINNED POLICY — the builder seeds exactly this, in `StubMenuDataSource.seeded`.
//
// 112 cells per window, for EVERY seeded course without exception. `isToday`
// true at index 2 only, never elsewhere — index 2 because a Sunday-aligned
// window puts a Tuesday there, which is where the mapping suite's and the E2E
// suite's pinned instants land too.
//
//   Data Engineering (1_498_777) — a today cell that ALSO carries work, proving
//     the outline does not obscure the fill:
//       2: .assignment (and isToday)   3: .quiz   5: .assignment   7: .quiz
//
//   Multivariate Calculus (1_415_558) — a today cell that is EMPTY, proving the
//     outline renders on an empty cell, plus work on the window's last index so
//     the trailing edge of a 16-week grid is visible:
//       2: nil (and isToday)   4: .quiz   8: .assignment
//      11: .quiz  ← the seeded "assignment + quiz same day", already resolved
//     111: .assignment  ← last cell of the window
//
//   Transformative Texts (1_460_912) — the state the old window could not have:
//     work on days of the CURRENT week that have already passed, one on either
//     side of the window's opening Sunday:
//       0: .assignment   1: .quiz
//
//   Computer Graphics Technology (1_452_301) and Purdue Civics (412_690) — the
//     honest "nothing due" window: 112 cells, every tier nil, isToday at 2.
//     Two of them, because under always-emit this is the common case and a
//     stub with only one would under-represent how the menu usually looks.
//
// Seeds are literals. Nothing here derives from `Date()`.
