/// programs, two languages, one layout — and nothing but agreement keeps them
/// pointed at the same directory. So this is a transcription of
/// `session-capture/src/paths.mjs`, clause by clause, and the only place in the
/// Swift side that joins a path onto the root:
///
/// ```js
/// const root = env.BSB_ROOT
///   ? path.resolve(env.BSB_ROOT)
///   : path.join(os.homedir(), "Library", "Application Support", "BrightspaceBar");
/// ```

/// Resolution is pure — it reports where things go and never creates them, so
/// resolving costs nothing and leaves nothing behind.
///
/// Only the data half is modelled here. `session.json` and `profile/` are the
/// daemon's alone (D7: secrets never cross into Swift), so this type cannot name
/// them.
