/// contracts"): `0` a fresh cache was written · `2` the ladder ran out and a
/// human is needed · `1` something unexpected. Anything else the app can observe
/// — it never started, it never finished — is its own case, because a failure
/// that reads as success would replace David's menu with an empty one.

/// This is the only place the app leaves its own process, and the two traps here
/// are both learned rather than imagined (RepoBar's `GitProcessRunner`):
///
///   - **No `Pipe`.** A pipe plus a wait deadlocks the moment the child fills the
///     ~64KB buffer, and a Node CLI logging its climb will. `stderr` goes to a
///     temp file; `stdout` goes to `/dev/null`, since the daemon reports through
///     `stderr` by contract (`refresh.mjs` logs with `console.error`).
///   - **The timeout must kill.** Not merely stop waiting: an abandoned child
///     would outlive the refresh that started it. SIGTERM, one second of grace,
///     then SIGKILL.
///
/// `stdin` is `/dev/null`, so a child that ever tries to ask a question gets EOF
/// instead of hanging a menu-bar app forever.
///
/// **D8: this type never invents an argument.** The child receives exactly
/// `arguments`, so `--allow-full-login` can only ever appear if a caller passed
/// it — and no app call site does. Every spawn the app makes is cron-safe.
