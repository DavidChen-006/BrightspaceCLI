/// The production timer: the thing that makes `PollTrigger.timer` more than a
/// value only tests ever pass.
///
/// A menu-bar app runs for weeks, so every failure mode of a long-lived timer is
/// cumulative, and each of the three answers here is deliberate (RepoBar's
/// `RefreshScheduler`, near-verbatim):
///
///   - `restart` **invalidates first**, always. A restart that left the old timer
///     running would double the daemon spawn rate silently, and the next one
///     would triple it.
///   - `stop` releases the handler as well as the timer. In production the
///     handler captures the poller, which holds the source, the cache and the
///     daemon runner; keeping a dead handler keeps all of it for the life of the
///     process.
///   - `isRunning` is **derived** from the timer, never stored. A separate bool
///     drifts out of sync with reality after the first missed invalidate, and
///     nothing ever notices.
///
/// `Timer` is a run-loop object, so this type is `@MainActor` and its tick runs
/// on the main actor — which is also where the caller wants to be when it
/// repaints a menu.
