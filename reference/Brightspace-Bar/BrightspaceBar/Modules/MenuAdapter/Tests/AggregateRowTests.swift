// ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// The two features this file pins:
//
//   • THE AGGREGATE ROW (Intent 3). When two or more course rows render, the
//     menu leads with `.course(CourseRow(id: -1, title: "All classes", …))`
//     followed by `.separator`, BEFORE the section headers. Its graph is the
//     fold of the rendered courses' strips (popup titles carry the course-label
//     prefix, "CS 25200 · Homework 2"), its submenu is empty (a view, not a
//     course), and its url is baseURL/d2l/home. With zero or one course there
//     is no aggregate row — the fold IS the course list.
//
//   • THE "THIS WEEK" BLOCK (week stats, Intent 5). `CourseRow.weekLines`
//     carries the per-course lines: a counts line for the current calendar week
//     ("2 assignments · 1 quiz", omitted when all zero), then the single next
//     item due at-or-after now across ALL upcoming work ("next: <name> · <Wkd>",
//     omitted when nothing is upcoming). Derived from unhidden, dated,
//     deadline-tiered fetched items (gradeOnly excluded) plus manual items —
//     the same population that fills the graph squares.
//
// SCOPE: all small. Pure translation over plain values; `now` and the zone are
// pinned the way GraphTranslationTests pins them, so every date literal below
// is a known local wall time in Indiana.
