// Announcements, end to end through the adapter: a course fetch lands, the
// announcement fan-out runs, and `currentMenu()` serves a submenu whose
// announcements section came from the store — the full production wiring with
// only the sources faked.
//
// PRIORITY: THE JOIN, not the rules. Every translation rule (cutoff, cap,
// order, silence on failure) is pinned in `AnnouncementTranslationTests`; every
// store/fetcher rule in `AnnouncementPipeline`'s own suites. What none of them
// can catch is a feed wired to the wrong store, a fan-out that never runs, or
// states read for the wrong course — the silent failures this file exists for.
//
// SCOPE: Google-medium by the adapter's own standard (actor hops, a scratch
// cache file), same as `EndToEndTests`.
