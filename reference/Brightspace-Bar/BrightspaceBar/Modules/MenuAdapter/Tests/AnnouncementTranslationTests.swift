// ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// THE SECOND JOIN — [Announcement] becomes the tail of CourseRow.submenu.
//
// The assignments half of a submenu answers "what do I owe?". This half answers
// "what did they say?", and it is a fundamentally different kind of list: work
// items are a SET (all of them, ordered by deadline), announcements are a
// WINDOW (the recent few, newest first). Everything below follows from that.
//
// PRIORITIES (the 1–2 carrying 80% of the value):
//
//   1. THE WINDOW IS THE WHOLE FEATURE. Which announcements qualify, in which
//      order, and how many — that is all this function decides, and every way of
//      deciding wrong is silent. A cutoff off by a second buries a post that
//      arrived this morning; a cutoff that never fires shows a syllabus notice
//      from last term as though it were news; a missing future-date guard
//      announces a post D2L has not published yet, which the student cannot open;
//      and an unstable order reshuffles the menu between refreshes, which also
//      breaks `MenuModel`'s `Equatable` skip-rebuild on identical data.
//
//   2. THE SECTION MUST NOT DAMAGE THE SUBMENU IT JOINS. This is a SUFFIX
//      appended to a shipped feature, so it can only be additive. Three failures
//      of that kind: an empty section (a separator and a header leading nothing,
//      in every submenu that has no recent posts), a second staleness note (the
//      assignments half already carries one, and two apologies in one submenu
//      read as two separate faults), and a row carrying a neighbouring course's
//      `ou=` — the same silent cross-wiring `AssignmentWiringTests` exists to
//      prevent, made possible again by a second per-course fan-out.
//
// CULLED: announcement BODY text (the daemon does not fetch it and the row has
// nowhere to put it), per-item deep links (D2L offers none worth trusting across
// tenants — every row goes to the course's announcements page by design), read
// versus unread state (unavailable from the payload), and localization (the app
// ships single-locale English, as the status line already does).
//
// SCOPE: all Google-small. Pure translation over plain values; `now` and the time
// zone are parameters, so nothing here reads a clock, a locale, or the world.
// ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// PINNED POLICY — the builder implements exactly these.
//
// ── AnnouncementTranslation.section(state:courseId:now:baseURL:timeZone:) ────
//   Returns the announcements SECTION appended to ONE course's submenu, AFTER
//   whatever `AssignmentTranslation.submenu` produced.
//
//     no qualifying announcements  →  []
//     one or more                  →  [.separator, .sectionHeader("Announcements")]
//                                     + rows
//
//   `[]` and not a "No announcements" line, which is the opposite of the
//   assignments half's rule and deliberately so. That line exists there because a
//   submenu with no rows at all gets no NSMenu and therefore a different
//   interaction model; here the assignments half has already guaranteed the
//   submenu exists, so silence costs nothing and a permanent empty section in
//   every quiet course costs two rows of noise.
//
// ── Qualifying: dated, within the last 30 days, not in the future ───────────
//     date == nil                  →  excluded
//     date <  now − 30 days        →  excluded
//     date >= now − 30 days        →  included   (boundary INCLUSIVE)
//     date <= now                  →  included   (boundary INCLUSIVE)
//     date >  now                  →  excluded
//
//   Undated items are excluded because a cutoff cannot be applied to a date that
//   does not exist — including them would put an item of unknown age at an
//   arbitrary position in a list whose entire ordering is by age. Future dates are
//   excluded because a `StartDate` ahead of now is a post D2L has SCHEDULED and
//   not yet published: announcing it early is announcing something the student
//   cannot go and read.
//
//   Both boundaries are inclusive, matching the convention `dueLabel` and the
//   currentness policy already use.
//
// ── Order and cap ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//   Newest first, then `id` ascending, capped at 5.
//
//   The `id` tie-break is not decoration. Swift's sort is not stable, so two posts
//   sharing an instant — routine when a department posts a batch — would otherwise
//   swap places between refreshes AND change WHICH five survive the cap, making
//   identical data compare unequal and rebuilding the menu on every timer tick.
//
// ── Rows ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//   title    │ verbatim
//   subtitle │ the absolute posting date, "MMM d" — e.g. "Aug 10", never padded
//   date     │ the raw instant, carried alongside the rendered form
//   url      │ AnnouncementLink.url(courseId:baseURL:) for EVERY row, derived
//             from the courseId PARAMETER and never from `Announcement.courseId`
//
//   An absolute date rather than "3 days ago": a relative string baked at
//   model-build time is stale the moment the menu is opened later, which is the
//   exact bug experiment 18 removed from the status row. The date does not move,
//   so the row does not go stale.
//
//   The month abbreviation must come from a FIXED English table and the day from
//   `Calendar(identifier: .gregorian)` in the supplied `timeZone` — NOT from
//   `DateFormatter`/`Date.FormatStyle`, which read `Locale.current` and would make
//   this pure function's output depend on the machine it runs on.
//
// ── States ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//     .neverFetched                 →  []
//     .loaded([])                   →  []
//     .loaded(all stale/undated)    →  []
//     .loaded(qualifying)           →  the section
//     .failed(lastKnown: [])        →  []
//     .failed(lastKnown: qualifying) →  the section, SILENTLY — no note
//
//   No staleness note here, on purpose: `AssignmentTranslation` already appends
//   one to the same submenu when its own fetch failed, and the two fetches fail
//   together (one dead session, both routes). Two notes in one submenu describe
//   one fault twice.
//
// ── MenuTranslation.menu gains `announcements: [Int: AnnouncementsState] = [:]`
//   Defaulted, so every existing call site compiles untouched and produces
//   byte-identical output — a course absent from the map is `neverFetched`, which
//   contributes no rows at all.
