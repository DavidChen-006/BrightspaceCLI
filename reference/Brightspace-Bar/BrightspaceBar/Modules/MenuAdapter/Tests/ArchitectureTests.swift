// Architecture — the rules Swift cannot express, enforced by reading source.
//
// PRIORITY: keeping the contract a contract. The entire value of `CourseMenu` is
// that the GUI cannot see backend types, which is what let the frontend be built
// and tested before any wiring existed. That guarantee used to be enforced by
// `Package.swift` — the GUI simply had no access. Phase 3 spent it: the composition
// root must see both sides to wire them together, so `BrightspaceBar` now depends
// on `MenuAdapter` and can therefore reach `CoursePipeline` transitively.
//
// SPM dependencies are per-target, not per-file, so nothing stops a later edit from
// importing `CoursePipeline` inside a view file and quietly reintroducing exactly
// the coupling this design exists to prevent. It would compile, ship, and pass every
// other test in this package.
//
// These tests are the replacement guarantee. They read the source directory and
// check import lines. Crude, and the only mechanism available.
//
// SCOPE: small. Reads files from the repository, no network, no build products.
