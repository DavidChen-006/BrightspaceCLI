// ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// THE JOIN — [Assignment] becomes CourseRow.submenu.
//
// Two finished halves meet here and nowhere else. `AssignmentPipeline` knows how
// to fetch, fold, and build a link; `BrightspaceBar` knows how to render a
// submenu. Neither knows the other exists. This file specifies the pure function
// between them.
//
// PRIORITIES (the 1–2 carrying 80% of the value):
//
//   1. CLICK-TARGET CORRECTNESS ACROSS THE JOIN. Course links were a
//      one-dimensional derivation (id → URL). An assignment link is
//      two-dimensional: (courseId, assignmentId) → URL, resolved for many courses
//      in one pass. That is a new failure mode — an assignment row sitting in
//      course A's submenu carrying course B's `ou=`. It fails silently: the page
//      loads, it is a genuine Brightspace page, and nothing announces that it is
//      somebody else's submission folder. Nothing downstream can catch it, because
//      the GUI opens whatever URL it is handed (`MenuAssembler` was deliberately
//      built with no index arithmetic, which pushes the entire burden here).
//
//   2. NO SILENT LOSS OF THE THREE STATES. `neverFetched` / `loaded([])` /
//      `failed(lastKnown:)` are distinct on purpose, and the GUI collapses one
//      distinction on its own: an EMPTY submenu produces no NSMenu at all. So
//      `loaded([])` translating to `[]` would render as "this feature does not
//      exist" rather than "nothing is due", and `failed` translating to `[]` would
//      silently blank a submenu that was showing real assignments a minute ago.
//
// CULLED: cosmetics beyond the pinned format, localization (single-locale app —
// the existing status line already ships English), performance (a handful of
// courses, a handful of assignments each), and any claim about what a hidden
// assignment's page actually renders (unobservable: no reachable course has one).
//
// SCOPE: all Google-small. Pure translation on plain values; `now` and the time
// zone are parameters. Two tests read fixture bytes off disk, but only to obtain
// inputs — the behaviour under test never touches I/O.
// ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// PINNED POLICY — the builder implements exactly these.
//
// ── MenuTranslation.menu gains two defaulted parameters ─────────────────────
//     assignments: [Int: AssignmentsState] = [:]
//     timeZone: TimeZone = .current
//   Both defaulted, and appended AFTER the existing four, so every one of the 227
//   existing call sites compiles untouched. A course absent from `assignments` is
//   `neverFetched` — which, since slice 5, still yields a submenu ("No
//   assignments"), so the default `[:]` no longer reproduces the pre-assignment
//   output. See the submenu-uniformity note below.
//
//   `timeZone` is a parameter for the same reason `now` is: a pure function may
//   not read ambient state. It is load-bearing rather than pedantic — D2L states
//   deadlines as instants (`2026-03-01T04:59:00.000Z` is 23:59 the PREVIOUS day
//   in Indiana), so formatting in the wrong zone shows the wrong deadline day.
//   `.current` belongs in the composition root; tests always pass it explicitly.
//
// ── AssignmentTranslation.submenu(state:courseId:now:baseURL:timeZone:) ─────
//   Returns the submenu rows for ONE course.
//
//     .neverFetched              →  [.message("No assignments")]
//     .loaded([])                →  [.message("No assignments")]
//     .loaded(visible)           →  [.assignment...]  sorted, no message
//     .loaded(all hidden)        →  [.message("No assignments")]
//     .failed(lastKnown: [])     →  [.message("Couldn't load assignments")]
//     .failed(lastKnown: rows)   →  [.assignment...] + .separator
//                                   + .message("Couldn't refresh — may be out of date")
//
//   `neverFetched` is still NOT a "Loading…" row: assignments are deliberately
//   not persisted, so at launch a course has never been asked about and nothing
//   is necessarily in flight, and "Loading…" would be a claim we cannot support.
//
//   What DID change in slice 5 is that it is no longer `[]`. The old policy — no
//   rows, therefore no NSMenu, therefore a plain directly-clickable course — gave
//   the menu two interaction models for rows that look identical, and which model
//   a row got depended on whether a fetch had happened yet. NewVertical-3 §2.3
//   retires it: every course gets at least `[Open Course Home]` + "No
//   assignments", so hovering any course does the same thing.
//
//   The cost is admitted rather than hidden: `neverFetched` and `loaded([])` now
//   render identically, so the submenu alone no longer distinguishes "not asked
//   yet" from "asked, and there are none". The states stay distinct in the store
//   (`AssignmentStoreTests` pins that), and the graph strip — emitted for every
//   state — is what carries the difference visually. Uniformity of interaction
//   was judged worth more than a distinction the user could not act on.
//
//   The separator appears ONLY when assignment rows precede the note. With no
//   rows it would abut the separator `MenuAssembler` already prepends.
//
// ── isHidden: hidden assignments are EXCLUDED ───────────────────────────────
//   `IsHidden` is D2L's own "not visible to students" flag, and respecting the
//   source of truth beats second-guessing it. The tie-breaker is priority 1: a
//   hidden folder is the case most likely to answer a deep link with an error or
//   an access-denied page, which is the same wrong-destination failure this suite
//   exists to prevent. All four real assignments have `IsHidden: false`, so this
//   costs nothing observable today, and it is one line in a pure function with a
//   test pinning it — reversible deliberately, not by accident.
//
// ── sort order (the GUI renders model order VERBATIM) ───────────────────────
//   1. dated assignments before undated ones
//   2. dated: `dueDate` ascending — soonest deadline first
//   3. undated, and any tie: `name` ascending (plain `<`, not locale-aware)
//   4. final tie-break: `id` ascending
//
//   Dated-first is what a student needs. Undated-last follows from having no
//   deadline to compete with. Today every reachable assignment is undated, so the
//   whole list is name-sorted — stable and sane; when a real term brings due
//   dates, deadlines float to the top without a code change. The `name`/`id`
//   tie-break is not decoration: without a total order, `Dictionary`-derived or
//   network-ordered input would reshuffle the submenu between refreshes and
//   `MenuModel`'s `Equatable` — which the GUI uses to skip rebuilding — would
//   compare unequal on identical data.
//
// ── AssignmentTranslation.dueLabel(_:now:timeZone:) → String? ───────────────
//     nil dueDate        →  nil          (the common case: all four real ones)
//     dueDate <  now     →  "Overdue"
//     dueDate >= now     →  "Due MMM d"  e.g. "Due Mar 1", "Due Feb 28"
//
//   Boundary is inclusive: exactly `now` is not yet overdue, matching the
//   inclusive convention the currentness policy already uses.
//
//   "Overdue" deliberately drops the date — once a deadline has passed, the date
//   is not the actionable part, and the currentness filter means only live
//   courses appear at all.
//
//   No year and no time of day. The month abbreviation must come from a FIXED
//   English table and the day from `Calendar(identifier: .gregorian)` with the
//   supplied `timeZone` — NOT from `DateFormatter`/`Date.FormatStyle`, which read
//   `Locale.current` and would make this function's output depend on ambient
//   state. Day is not zero-padded ("Due Mar 1", never "Due Mar 01").
