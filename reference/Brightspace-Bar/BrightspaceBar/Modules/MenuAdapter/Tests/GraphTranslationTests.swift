// ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// THE GRAPH MAPPING — due-date instants → a 112-cell window of local days.
//
// This is the arithmetic half of the activity graph: everything between "D2L
// said this is due at instant X" and "the renderer fills cell N". It is a pure
// function of `(state, now, timeZone)`, which is the whole reason it can be
// pinned this densely — no clock, no calendar of the machine, no stored window
// to drift.
//
// RE-PINNED for NewVertical-3 §4: the window was 28 days starting at today, and
// `.neverFetched` yielded `[]`. It is now 112 days (16 weeks) starting on the
// SUNDAY of today's week, emitted for every state including `.neverFetched`.
//
// PRIORITIES:
//
//   1. THE BUCKETING IS SILENTLY WRONG WHEN IT IS WRONG. A deadline is a UTC
//      instant; a cell is a LOCAL calendar day. `2026-02-13T04:30:00Z` is 23:30
//      on **February 12** in Indiana, and an implementation that reads the UTC
//      day, or that walks the window in 86_400-second steps, draws that work on
//      the wrong square. Nothing downstream can catch it: a filled cell one
//      column over is still a perfectly plausible-looking grid, and the student
//      reads it as "not due until tomorrow". Every date literal below is
//      therefore stated twice — as its UTC instant and as its local wall time —
//      and the expectations were derived from the local side.
//
//   2. THE WINDOW'S ORIGIN IS LOAD-BEARING AND EQUALLY SILENT. §3.3's seam
//      promises the frontend that `index = day offset from window start`, that
//      the window STARTS ON A WEEK BOUNDARY, and that N is a multiple of 7.
//      Slice 4 derives `row = i % 7` from exactly that and labels row 0 Sunday.
//      A window that opens on today instead of Sunday still renders a perfectly
//      plausible grid — every cell simply sits under the wrong weekday, and the
//      M/W/F labels lie. There is no `windowStart` in the contract to assert on,
//      so alignment is pinned the only way it is observable: by where known
//      local days land. `todayIsNotAlwaysCellZero` and
//      `theWindowOpensOnTheSundayOfTodaysWeek` are the tests that catch it.
//
// CULLED: anything about how a cell is DRAWN (colour, size, the today outline's
// geometry) — that is slice 4 and unobservable from here; and the grid's
// orientation, which the renderer owns. Also culled: fetching, folding, and
// staleness, all already pinned by `AssignmentStore`'s own suite. This file only
// asks where a date lands.
//
// SCOPE: all small. Pure translation over plain values, `now` and `timeZone`
// supplied. No `TimeZone.current`, no `Date()`, anywhere.
// ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// PINNED POLICY — the builder implements exactly this.
//
//     public enum GraphTranslation {
//         public static let windowDays = 112
//         /// AssignmentsState + now + timeZone → the 112-cell window. Pure.
//         public static func strip(
//             state: AssignmentsState, now: Date, timeZone: TimeZone
//         ) -> [GraphCell]
//     }
//
// The API surface does NOT change — only the values it produces. Same file, same
// signature, same purity rules.
//
// ── The window: 112 local calendar days, week-aligned ───────────────────────
//   Cell index = the whole-day offset from WINDOW START, where window start is
//   the local start of the SUNDAY of the week containing `now`'s local day, in
//   `timeZone`. Sunday because that is GitHub's convention and slice 4's row-0
//   label assumes it; `now` itself lands somewhere in cells 0–6.
//
//   112 = 16 × 7. A whole number of weeks is not decoration: §3.3 promises the
//   renderer that N is a multiple of 7, and a ragged final column would be a
//   contract violation the renderer cannot detect.
//
//   Recomputed from `now` on every call — no stored window to drift, which is
//   why the grid "shifts" a week at a time with no state to move.
//
//   Whole CALENDAR days, not 86_400-second steps. The two disagree across a DST
//   transition, and `daysCrossingTheSpringForwardStayWholeDays` is the test that
//   separates them.
//
//   Computed with `Calendar` in the INJECTED `timeZone`. No `Date()`, no
//   `.current`, no `Locale` from the machine.
//
// ── Bucketing: an instant lands on its LOCAL day ────────────────────────────
//   `dueDate` is a UTC instant; the cell is the local calendar day it falls on
//   in `timeZone`. 23:30 local on day N buckets to day N even though its UTC
//   representation reads day N+1. This is priority 1 and the classic off-by-one.
//
// ── Fill: highest tier wins ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//   `.assignment → CellTier.assignment`, `.quiz → CellTier.quiz`; a day holding
//   several items renders as `itemsDueThatDay.map(\.tier).max()`. Assignment plus
//   quiz on one day is `.quiz`, because `2 > 1`. Nothing due is `nil` — an empty
//   day, not a zero-th tier, and it still occupies its index.
//
// ── Excluded from the fill (never from the count) ───────────────────────────
//   • `isHidden` items — the same policy the submenu already applies, so a
//     student never sees a square for work D2L is hiding from them.
//   • `dueDate == nil` items — the normal case in every currently reachable
//     course; there is no day to draw them on.
//   • Anything due before WINDOW START, or on/after day 112.
//   The window is ALWAYS 112 cells regardless: exclusion empties a cell, it
//   never shortens the window.
//
//   NOTE the changed lower bound. The exclusion is no longer "before today" —
//   it is "before the window", and the window now opens up to six days behind
//   today. Work due on Monday when today is Tuesday DOES fill Monday's cell:
//   the grid shows the current week honestly, including the part of it that has
//   already passed. `workDueEarlierThisWeekStillFillsItsCell` pins this, and it
//   is the direct inversion of the old `workDueYesterdayIsExcluded`.
//
//   Within a day the bound stays day-granular, not instant-granular. Work due
//   at 08:00 this morning still fills today's cell when `now` is 10:00.
//
// ── isToday: the true today cell, wherever that falls ───────────────────────
//   Set on the cell whose local day is `now`'s local day — index 0 through 6,
//   NOT index 0 by construction — and on no other cell. Exactly one cell
//   carries it. It stays orthogonal to the fill: a separate field, never a fill
//   value, which is what makes "the today indicator must not obscure the
//   activity state" hold by construction rather than by careful drawing.
//
// ── States: the window is emitted for ALL of them ──────────────────────────
//     .neverFetched  →  112 cells     (§2 item 2: an absent grid reads as a bug)
//     .loaded(_)     →  112 cells     (an empty list is data: 112 empty days)
//     .failed(_, _)  →  112 cells     built from `lastKnown`
//   `[]` is no longer a reachable output. A missing grid is indistinguishable
//   from a rendering failure; an empty grid honestly says "nothing due". The
//   decision lives here, in the pure layer, so the renderer never invents cells.
//
// ── Wiring ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//   `MenuTranslation.menu` hands each `CourseRow` a
//   `graph: GraphTranslation.strip(state:now:timeZone:)` for that course's state.
//   A course absent from the assignments map is `neverFetched` — and now that
//   too carries a full, empty window, so EVERY course row in the menu has a
//   grid. Uniformity is the point (§2 item 2).
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
