// Where the boundaries go (NewVertical-3.md §3.1).
//
// §3.1 chooses standalone hairline rows over in-component lines, and names the
// cost explicitly: "Boundaries become structure you must place (fence-post cases
// are yours)". This file is that cost, paid in tests. Placement is a rule in the
// PURE translation layer — not a decision a component view makes while drawing —
// so it is testable with plain values and nothing else.
//
// PRIORITIES (the 1–2 carrying 80% of the value):
//
//   1. THE FENCE-POST CASES ARE RIGHT. The tradeoff table's "Stacking" row is the
//      whole reason this decision was made: in-component lines double at every
//      boundary. A placement rule that emits a trailing hairline after the last
//      course, or two in a row between groups, reintroduces exactly the doubling
//      the design bought its way out of. One line per boundary, explicit.
//
//   2. NOTHING ELSE MOVED. Boundaries are inserted into a row list that other
//      suites, the assembler, and the GUI's Equatable skip-rebuild all read. The
//      courses, their order, their grouping, and the footer must come out
//      byte-identical to before — a hairline rule that also perturbed grouping
//      would be caught here rather than by a confusing failure three files away.
//
// CULLED: colour, thickness, inset, row height — the view's, pinned as structure
// (class + frame, never pixel colours) in
// `Modules/BrightspaceBar/Tests/HairlineRenderingTests.swift`. Also culled:
// re-testing url derivation, subtitles, grouping order and status text, all of
// which `MenuTranslationTests` already owns; this file asserts only what the new
// rule changes.
//
// SCOPE: all small. Pure function, plain values, no I/O, no clock.
// ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

// PINNED PLACEMENT — the builder implements exactly this.
//
// At TOP LEVEL, a `.hairline` sits BETWEEN consecutive `.course` rows — never
// before the first (2026-08-29: a leading hairline stacked on the aggregate's
// native separator and read as a double rule; term headers are gone too, so
// groups survive as order only):
//
//     .course(…)
//     .hairline                  ← between consecutive courses
//     .course(…)
//     .hairline                  ← a group edge is just two consecutive courses
//     .course(…)
//     .separator                 ← UNCHANGED: the footer stays a native separator
//     .status(…)
//     .command(.refresh)
//     .command(.quit)
//
// Equivalently: one hairline per course, never two adjacent, never trailing.
//
// SUBMENUS NEVER CONTAIN HAIRLINES. A submenu is one course's own assignments;
// there is no boundary in it to draw.
//
// The footer `.separator` before the status row is deliberately left alone —
// converting it is out of this slice's scope.
