// ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// MenuAdapter.timerTick() — the production timer's entry point.
//
// Until now the timer was wired straight to `Poller.tick(.timer)` in main.swift,
// which refreshes COURSES ONLY (LADDER-PLAN, "Phase 3 outcomes"). Assignments are
// deliberately not persisted, so the only things that ever refresh them are
// `launch()` and a manual `refresh()` — and a laptop left open for a day therefore
// shows submenus from whenever it was last clicked. `timerTick()` closes that gap.
//
// PRIORITIES (the 1–2 carrying 80% of the value):
//
//   1. THE TIMER KEEPS ALL OF THE DATA FRESH, not half of it. The gap being closed
//      is specifically the assignment half, so the claim is observed where the user
//      would see it: the rows in the next `currentMenu()`.
//
//   2. THE TIMER IS STILL GOVERNED BY PollPolicy. `refresh()` maps to `.manual`,
//      which ALWAYS fetches; the whole reason `timerTick()` may not be spelled
//      `refresh()` is that a timer firing every 15 minutes against a cache that is
//      still fresh would spawn the daemon for nothing. `.timer` must reach the
//      policy intact.
//
// CULLED: the daemon's argv (D8) — a `CourseSource` carries no spawn, so at this
// layer there is nothing to observe and a fake that pretended otherwise would test
// itself; `DaemonRunner`'s own suite owns that claim. Also culled: timing (call
// counts instead), coalescing (`Poller` owns and tests it), and disk format.
//
// SCOPE: medium — the real Poller, the real PollPolicy, a real CourseCache on a
// real file, the real EnrollmentParser and the real AssignmentFetcher/Store. Only
// the two sources are doubles.

// Same shape as `launch()`, one trigger different:
//
//   1. load from disk if that has not happened yet (as every entry point does),
//   2. `poller.tick(.timer)` — NOT `.manual`, NOT `.launch`,
//   3. refresh the assignments.
//
// It returns nothing for the same reason `launch()` does: the caller repaints by
// asking `currentMenu()` afterwards, so the trigger path and the read path stay
// separate. What `timerTick()` does when the policy DECLINES the course fetch is
// deliberately not pinned here — the assignment fan-out costs no spawn either way
// (`DaemonAssignmentSource` reads the cache the course fetch already wrote), so
// that is the builder's call.
