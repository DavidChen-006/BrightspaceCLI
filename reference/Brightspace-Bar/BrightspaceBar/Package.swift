import PackageDescription

// One package, six modules, each self-contained under Modules/<Name>/ with its
// own Sources/, Tests/, and Makefile. The dependency arrows that matter:
//
//   CoursePipeline  ←──  AssignmentPipeline  (backend: per-course work items)
//        ↑                            ↑
//        └──────────────────  QuizPipeline   (quiz parsing + the quiz deep link)
//        ↑
//   MenuAdapter ──→ CourseMenu   (the contract: pure values, no AppKit, no network)
//                       ↑
//                  BrightspaceBar (the GUI)
//
// There is no session module any more: credentials live entirely on the Node
// daemon's side of the boundary (LADDER-PLAN D7), and the backend's only source
// of data is the cache the daemon writes.
//
// BrightspaceBar depends on CourseMenu ONLY — it cannot see `Course`, cookies,
// JWTs, or URLSession. That is what lets the GUI be built and tested against
// seeded stubs, and stops backend detail from leaking into view code.
//
// The one concession: `main.swift` is the composition root, so it must see both
// sides to wire them together. Swift cannot restrict imports per file, so that
// rule is enforced by a test (`ArchitectureTests`).
