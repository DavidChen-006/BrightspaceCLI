/**
 * The ladder: fetch with the credentials already on disk, and only if the
 * SESSION is what failed, climb the rungs — silent first, and the `full` rung
 * (the one that puts a browser in front of a human) only when the caller proved
 * a human is present. A timer spawn may climb rung 1 and no further; otherwise
 * cron pops a login window at 3am.
 *
 * Two invariants outrank freshness, because the menu bar is read by a human who
 * cannot tell "loading" from "gone":
 *
 *  1. A failed run leaves the app exactly as well off as it was — the existing
 *     data.json survives untouched (the `.preservedStale` mirror), and no
 *     half-written file is ever visible to the Swift reader.
 *  2. status.json says the true thing about what just happened, including
 *     carrying forward when the last SUCCESS was.
 *
 * Shape: `runRefresh` is the shell (clock, files, rungs, fetcher — all
 * injected); `statusFrom` and `exitCode` are the pure core. The world arrives
 * as deps so every ladder behavior is testable with plain values and a temp dir.
 *
 * D7: credentials live in session.json and stop there. Nothing here reads that
 * file, and every log line is composed from names and reasons this module owns
 * — never from a fetched or captured value.
