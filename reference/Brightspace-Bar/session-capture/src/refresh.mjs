 * Deliberately thin. Everything worth testing lives in orchestrate.mjs behind
 * injected seams; this file only turns argv into deps and a status into an exit
 * code. `--allow-full-login` is the permission bit: the timer spawn omits it
 * (cron may only ever climb the silent rung), the manual Refresh click passes
 * it, because the click is the proof that a human is present for the MFA.
 *
 * `--help` must stay free of side effects — no files, no browser import. It is
 * the one command a human runs to find out what this thing does.
