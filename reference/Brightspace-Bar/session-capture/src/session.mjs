/**
 * The session.json output contract, as pure functions.
 *
 * Everything that consumes a captured session — `BrightspaceBar`'s
 * `FileSessionProvider`, every experiment probe — reads these four fields, so the
 * shape is decided in exactly one place and is testable without a browser.
 *
 * Provenance: these two functions originate in
 * `experiment-1-fresh-cookie/src/acquire-session.mjs`, where they were written and
 * proven. That folder is a frozen experiment record and keeps its own copy; this
 * is the live definition that tooling depends on. The duplication is deliberate —
 * importing across a folder we might one day delete would be a latent trap, and a
 * frozen file cannot drift.
