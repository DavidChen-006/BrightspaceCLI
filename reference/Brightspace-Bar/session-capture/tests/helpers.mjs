/**
 * Shared test scaffolding for the phase-1 orchestrator spine.
 *
 * Two rules shape everything here:
 *
 *  1. HERMETIC. Every test gets its own BSB_ROOT under os.tmpdir(), removed
 *     when the test ends. No test may touch the real
 *     `~/Library/Application Support/BrightspaceBar`, the network, or a
 *     browser — the daemon's real credentials are production data.
 *  2. THE WORLD IS INJECTED. Rungs, the fetcher and the clock are the three
 *     seams `runRefresh` takes as deps. The fakes below script their answers,
 *     record their calls, and never do I/O of their own, so every ladder
 *     behavior is a small (Google-small) test with no wall-clock dependence.
