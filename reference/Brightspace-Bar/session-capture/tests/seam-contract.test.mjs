/**
 * The seam contract: every rung and every fetcher — the fakes the orchestrator
 * suite is built on AND the real implementations phase 2 adds — answering the
 * same questions.
 *
 * Priority this file defends: THE FAKES CANNOT DRIFT. Phase 1's 46 tests prove
 * the ladder is correct against scripted fakes. That proof is worth exactly as
 * much as the claim that the real rung and the real fetcher answer in the same
 * vocabulary — the same `kind` strings, the same `ok` shape, the same
 * `sessionExpired` spelling. Nothing else in the suite compares the two, so a
 * real fetcher reporting `session_expired`, or a real rung whose kind is
 * "silent-sso", would pass every other test in the package and strand the
 * ladder in production.
 *
 * Behavior axis: invariants only. The interesting per-implementation cases live
 * in fetch-engine.test.mjs and rungs.test.mjs; what is checked here is the
 * handful of properties that must hold for EVERY implementation of the seam.
 *
 * Scope: small. Both seams are exercised with their I/O injected.
